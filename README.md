I created this project to learn concepts of Bayesian Decision Network.

The objective is to implement an adaptive testing technology using Bayesian Network.
This adaptive test was designed as such that it could pinpoint the studentâ€™s weakness or strength in different sub-domains of the
considered subjects or field. To create the test I took question sets from Elementary Fractions taught in the Mathematics course of grade 5 and 6 students. The model for the subject (in our case Elementary Fractions) was created manually (since we college students consider ourselves expert enough to create question on this field target grade 5 students).
These types of modelsare referred as expert centric Bayesian model
